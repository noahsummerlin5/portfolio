# N-Body Orbital Simulator
# PycharmProjects/my-python-app/space-simulator is where my current project is located (as of 9/9/24), under "main".
#   Play around with different bodies, orbits, whatever - by default there's an orbital system of the Earth ("planet") and the Moon ("moon"), along with a massive third body for fun ("third").
