<b>N-Body Orbital Simulator:</b><br>
PycharmProjects/my-python-app/space-simulator/n-body_1.1 is the current iteration of this project. <br><br>
Play around with different bodies, wacky (or practical) orbits, removing some after some time "w" to see how it affects things, whatever - by default there's an orbital system of the Earth ("planet") and the Moon ("moon"), along with a massive third body for fun ("third"). Play with the simulation parameters if you'd like - the notes should be fairly intuitive. Have fun! :)

<b>Arduino Altimeter:</b><br>
Arduino/altimeter_1.1 is the current iteration of this project. <br><br>
It's the basic code for an Arduino connected to the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect the time to ping 8 bursts and calculate the distance of the sensor from the ground. It will function as a low-altitude altimeter for the smaller prototype of the Florida Rocket Lab's VTVL "Hopper," who we nicknamed "Skipper," integrated with the flight computer so we can have accurate readings on our height as we enter the last stretch of our descent - crucial for a smooth landing.
