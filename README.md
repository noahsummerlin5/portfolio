<b>N-Body Orbital Simulator:</b><br>
PycharmProjects/my-python-app/space-simulator is where my current project is located (as of 9/9/24), under "main". <br>
<p>Play around with different bodies, wacky (or practical) orbits, removing some after some time "w" to see how it affects things, whatever - by default there's an orbital system of the Earth ("planet") and the Moon ("moon"), along with a massive third body for fun ("third"). Notes should be intuitive enough to figure out what to do :)
